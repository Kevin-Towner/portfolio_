        <h1>NJ Transit Mobile App - Redesign</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Many would agree with the statement,<span style = "font-weight:bolder; color:#9942ED;"> "commuting via public transportation is less stressful than commuting by personal vehicle"</span>. Despite having more direct control over the route and speed, many commuters and travelers like public transportation. The ability to be productive on the train or to take a nap the bus are nice features of public transportation. Many experts also believe public transportation is more environmentally sustainable.

		            It is widely known that commuting via public transportation is one of the least stressful ways of travel. Despite having control over more variables when using a personal vehicle, driving may be the most stressful form of travel. Using public transportation is also thought of as being more environmentally sustainable and better for the environment.
		            <br>
		            <br>
		            If using public transportation is less stressful, why are so many transit app UIs not reflective of this stress-free commutting process? When using the NJ Transit App I am able to buy tickets, view schedules and plan a trip. However, these are all separate processes and do not allow the user to streamline a true "Trip Planning" process.

			<h2>Research, Qualitative Analysis & Personas</h2>
			<h3>Conduct Interviews</h3>
			<p class = "paragraph">I chose to interview four participants for my qualitative research. The participants comprise of 2 separate archetypes (Millennial &amp Boomer) and were chosen to illustrate a wide group of NJ-Transit users. The questions asked were designed to guage the way the NJ-Transit users view commuting to and from New York City via NJ-Transit ( RAIL ). Also, the questions were designed to gain opinions on GPS/Navigation applications and how they assist the user in their travels. As the role of the researcher, I wanted to know how the users feel when using public transportation, the stressors they encounter and other UIs the they may use to assist them where the current NJ-Transit App cannot.   </p>

			<h3>Key Findings</h3>
			<p class = "paragraph">
				The Millennial archetypes don't encounter as much difficulty when using public transportation. If they do happen to get lost, they don't seem to mind because they rely on their smart devices and/or GoogleMaps for assistance. Some features of GPS-based applications the Millennials enjoy are historic traffic patterns, traffic alerts and user feedback.
				<br>
				The Baby-Boomer archetypes are more likely to use their smart-devices for assistance via Uber. It's important to note that many Baby-Boomers aren't commuting to NYC for work as many are retired or simply go to the city for events and shows. With this in mind, taking an Uber is fairly straight-forward and leaves no desire to take the NYC subway.
