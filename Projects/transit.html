        <h2>Original Ideas (pre-research)</h2>
        <p>Originally, I had thought about the idea of designing NJ Transit as a GPS-based application first. In many ways, this application would mirror something akin to Google Maps, or even Waze. Therefore, many of my research questions were heavily designed to obtain user insights on pre-existing applications which commuters use to get to and from NY / NJ.</p>

        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>The results of the research weren't unpredictable, but it provided good information to be taken into consideration when wireframing and planning NJ Transit's user experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class = "bolden">Millennials...</span><br>
        are generally not intimidated by the use of technology, nor were they really intimidated by the complexities of navigation and city-travel. What was most important to them was to have an app that allows them to conveniently plan their trips while utilizing features that other GPS applications have. Traffic patterns, subway maps and subway navigation is extremely important to maintain a strict sense of time and personal finance.
        <br>
        <Br>
        <span class = "bolden">Baby Boomers...</span>
        <br>
        are more concerned with navigation and the use of technology. Many would opt to arrive in the city and pay for the convenience of an Uber. The ability to purchase tickets and plan their NJ Transit arrivals/departures are priority. The ability for them see a map-view of where they are could also be helpful in the incident that they do get lost. Knowing that they can have a map on them is a nice cushion that many may use as navigation around New York City can be intimidating.

            <p>From the research I decided against my original, GPS-first, idea. I felt having the homescreen as a GPS interface would end up being counter intuitive to the app's main purpose. Having the homescreen or splash page serve as a location-based GPS would create a layer of complexity not intuitive to a wide range of ages.</p>
