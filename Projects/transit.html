        <p>Upon signing up for Brainstation's UX Design course, I realized I was about to step into unfamiliar territory. In order to get to the course on time, I would need to rush out of work 30 minutes early, take the train from Rahway Junction to NY Penn Station, figure out which subway to take (which, for me, meant I had to confidently distinguish which subway entrance was good vs no good), head downtown into the Soho area, and finally walk to the course's location.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was born in, and have always lived in, the suburbs. I had only gone into NYC, alone, twice  and I went begrudgingly...AND I took a cab from NY Penn Station. Being the habitual over-thinker that I am, I was imagining myself getting off at the wrong stop, somehow losing my phone, having to ask for directions which may lead to a mugging attempt and disappearing into obscurity (not really). With all that lingering over my head, I did what anyone else in my shoes would do; research and plan my trip.
        <br>
        <br>
        I figured using the NJ Transit App would be a good place to start. Granted, I had used the NJ Transit app before but I had only used it to purchase tickets. The app has a "Plan Trip" button, but what I ended up doing was using NJ Transit's mobile app to review the schedule and purchase tickets. I had to use Google Maps to help me with the majority of my trip, which worked out fine, but from a user experience perspective I was not impressed. Using two apps to help a person get from point A to point B is counter intuitive and creates more work for the user. The only real use, I see NJ Transit's mobile app to be helpful for, is for purchasing tickets.
