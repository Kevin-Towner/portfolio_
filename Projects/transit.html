          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Upon signing up for a <span class = "paragraph-bold">UX Design</span> course at <span class = "paragraph-bold">Brainstation in New York City</span>, I wanted to gain a good understanding of my commute to the campus. I was not confident in my ability to navigate the city and/or city subway system without getting lost and I know others feel the same way I do.
            <br>
            <br>
          I had already used the Mobile NJ Transit App in the past to purchase tickets, but I had never used the <span class = "paragraph-bold">Trip Planning functionality</span> because it doesn't have a lot to offer. Aside from selecting my stations, informing me of the ticket prices, and which corridor I will need to enter, I never felt the mobile app was of much help.
            <br>
            <br>
          The app does a fine job of giving the user information he or she will need to successfully travel from one station to another, but it doesn't offer these steps in an intuitive manner. The app also doesn't offer any assistance outside of the scope of NJ Transit.

        <h2>Original Ideas (pre-research)</h2>
        <p>Originally, I had thought about the idea of designing NJ Transit as a GPS-based application first. In many ways, this application would mirror something akin to Google Maps, or even Waze. Therefore, many of my research questions were heavily designed to obtain user insights on pre-existing applications which commuters use to get to and from NY / NJ.</p>

              <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
              <p>I conducted interviews with four different people comprising of two separate archetypes; Millennials and Baby Boomers. I figured the millennials could provide the perspective of a working commuter who takes the train to his/her job and back. On the other hand, the baby boomer generation could represent someone who goes into the city on his or her weekend to see a show, go to a nice restaraunt, ect. The color-coding of interviewee responses represents motivations (pink), behaviors (blue) and pain-points (green).

              <h3>Responses and Solutions</h3>
              <p>Upon analyzing and color-coding the interviewee responses, I organized each highlighted section into their respective sections. The three types of responses became the base of where I came up with design improvements and functionality upgrades to NJ Transit.

        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>The results of the research weren't unpredictable, but it provided good information to be taken into consideration when wireframing and planning NJ Transit's user experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        <span class = "bolden">Millennials...</span><br>
        are generally not intimidated by the use of technology, nor were they really intimidated by the complexities of navigation and city-travel. What was most important to them was to have an app that allows them to conveniently plan their trips while utilizing features that other GPS applications have. Traffic patterns, subway maps and subway navigation is extremely important to maintain a strict sense of time and personal finance.

        <span class = "bolden">Baby Boomers...</span>
        <br>
        are more concerned with navigation and the use of technology. Many would opt to arrive in the city and pay for the convenience of an Uber. The ability to purchase tickets and plan their NJ Transit arrivals/departures are priority. The ability for them see a map-view of where they are could also be helpful in the incident that they do get lost. Knowing that they can have a map on them is a nice cushion that many may use as navigation around New York City can be intimidating.

          <h2>1st Iteration</h2>
          <p>From the research I acquired, I decided it would be best to sway away from my original idea of redesigning NJ Transit's mobile app as a GPS-first app. The app should be a tool for commuters and travelers to use for trip planning and ticket purchasing.</p>
