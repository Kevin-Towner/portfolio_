          <h2>What is Katana Zero?</h2>
          <p>Katana Zero is an 16-bit indie game developed by Askiisoft and produced by Devolver Digital. Upon release, this game has received positive reviews for it's visual aesthetic and fast-paced action. Although it's an indie game, it is fairly complex with difficult controls to master. You play the role of "Zero", a Samurai who works as a hitman. living in a world which is still on the mend from a brutal war. In exchange for killing his targets, Zero is awarded Chronos a drug he is mentally dependent on.
          <br>
          <br>
          During this supposed war, soldiers were given Chronos which gives them the ability to slow time and even forsee the future actions of their next moves. With the help of this drug, Zero is tasked with killing many high-ranking personnel who were big players in the production of said drug. Eventually finding out the people he has been killing are connected with the drug, Zero uncovers a dark conspiracy. Since the drug is directly related to the abusers' sense of time, Zero begins to question his very existence as time becomes more warped the more hits he carries out.
