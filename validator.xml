<dc:title>Every Trader Joe's Beer, Ranked by Great Divide's Head Brewer1`</dc:title>
<dc:description>Ethan Osborne, the head of Denver brewery Great Divide, blindly tasted all beers from Trader Joe's and ranked them </dc:description>
<dcterms:abstract>All beers were given to Ethan in a tasting glass without him seeing the label, and he was asked to rate them on two criteria: taste and whether or not he'd order another one. Is this 100% scientific? No. Is this 100% a great way to learn if you should buy one of TJ's beers over another? Of course. Bonus: all of these 29 beers cost $40.37 before tax -- you can stock up.</dcterms:abstract>
